# OV7670 Camera module driver developed for a school project.

The driver utilizes the DCMI module and DMAs on the STM32H7A4 microcontroller to offload the CPU, when capturing images. This repository lacks some of the developed modules and will therefor not be able to run, however it can be used as an inspiration for developing future drivers for the OV7670 module. The program uses RTOS as the full project handled multiple processes.
